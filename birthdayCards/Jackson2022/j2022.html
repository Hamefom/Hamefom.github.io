                <p>I hope that you’ve enjoyed the wild and eventful year you’ve had! And that you’re looking forward to what the coming years bring!
                </p>

                <p>You’re a lovely friend to have, and I’m very thankful to have met you, good sir! ^^  Not only were ya a ton of fun to hang with back in highschool, but you helped me score the best job I’ve had so far! I love working with you, and everyone at the store. Really is nice working alongside a family, and makes it feel like a home away from home. So, thankyou for helping me get hired here :)
                </p>

                <p>But on top of the fun environment at work, it’s just nice being friends with ya. I went through a lot of different things with TJ, and you were there to help bounce ideas and thoughts off of. And even if we don’t always see eye to eye, it’s a pleasure knowing ya :D</p>
            
                <p>Thanks for being such a goofball, and another glittering star that makes the night sky of my life twinkle so brightly!  </p>
            
                <p>I love ya buddy! Sorry for forgetting last year’s card. I hope this one makes up for that a bit!</p>
            
                <p>From your friend,</p>
